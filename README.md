# North-Yankton
fly to North Yankton with a one rise ticket, a day ticket or a faction ticket, build your own buildings there and have fun to explore North Yankton again!


# how to install

1. execute the ticket.sql file to import it into your database, if you got no database, check out the forum. (it has been explained a couple million times though)

2. If you have done that, go to the config.lua and fit it to your needings or just keep it as it is.

3. put "start north-yankton" into your server.cfg file

4. restart your server and have fun!

# what do I need?

If you have followed the install steps above then you'll still need these resources:

1. NativeUI
2. es_extended (and all dependencies of it)

# where to start?

The resource does not give many options you can do, it is simply a script to make a travel to North-Yankton. You can rent cars there and explore the world as you want.

# re-edits / re-release...

You have the rights to republish the resource as long as you edit the resource to the extent that it contains several built-in features that expands the resource in a useful way and if you credit me for my part of the code. (if you don't want to republish it, then you can edit it as you want.)
